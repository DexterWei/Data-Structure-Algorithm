This work implements a decision tree.
Feed the program with training data, a tree will be built.
Use the tree as a predictor on test data to check out its accuracy.

Use the make file:
$make tree //compile the tree.cpp
$make tree_pred.h //build a predictor based on training data
$make predict_tree //test the predictor on test data

tree_predictor.cpp, Makefile and the train&test data files are provided by Professor H.T Lin and TA crew.
